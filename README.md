# phasmo-journal
This is a small project for myself to help deepen my understanding of Git, GitHub 
and using an Object Orientated Language. 

If you have heard of the game Phasmophobia, I am working on making a journal that 
user can utilise to aid in finding what ghost is hiding in the property, 
and what evidence is left to find. 

Multiple updates are expected.
